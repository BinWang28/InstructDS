No news at all regarding the house :(( We'll be sitting on it till the end of our lives!\nLeu: That can't be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It's a matter of time.\nLuisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market.\nLeu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland.\nLuisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.\nLeu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?\nLuisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!\nLeu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight.\nLuisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples.\nLeu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor.\nLuisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him.\nLeu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it?\nLuisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day.\nLeu: Therapy?\nLuisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.\nLeu: Nor can I.\nLuisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.\nLeu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.\nLuisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...\nLeu: Right you are! \"The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different.\" Do you remember?\nLuisa: \"Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand.

She has had 2 stents fitted.\nJill: Oh Doris! So sorry! But good news she is on the mend. Miracles of medicine.\nDoris: This has given the family a great shock as she was so well. She walked a 21 km marathon on Sunday.\nJill: Did she strain her heart during the walk?\nDoris: We don't know, but there is also sign of an injury a long while ago. It worries me that there was no warning.\nJill: It is worrying that we can't see what's getting weaker within us. No warnings as you say. How does she take it emotionally?\nDoris: She is quite strong.\nJill: Good! You too I hope?\nDoris: Yes, absolutely.\nJill: Keep it up! Where is she?\nDoris: Pietermaritzburg\nJill: How long do you have to drive there?\nDoris: 1.5 hours off peak traffic.\nJill: Not so bad. Will you be driving to see her soon?\nDoris: Dunno yet. Her condition is stable. She's got her husband and 3 children around her. But I may go and stay with her when she's back home.\nJill: To help with the household?\nDoris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.\nJill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?\nDoris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally. She's strong but her body may need a rest. We'll see!\nJill: I'll keep fingers crossed for you! Both of you.\nDoris: Thx Jill. You never know what helps :))\nJill: Take care my friend!\nDoris: You too.",

It will help the teachers and TAs anyway, they have a lot to cope with!\nGita: I know, I could never do their job! I work part time as a music teacher, going round schools.\nBev: Oh really? I am in Marks, part time too, love it there! \nGita: Yes, it really helps to do some sort of work doesn't it! I could never manage full time, though.\nBev: Oh, I know, Gita. My sister's in management and she doesn't see her kids from 6.30am to 6.30pm every day! She is a high flier, but she does miss them. She does do lots with them on the weekend, though.\nGita: Yes, but children need time to just be at home and play or just be with family, not galavanting around all the time!\nBev: I agree 100%! Is Beti looking forward to feeding the lambs and seeing the baby animals on the farm, Milo is very excited.\nGita: Oh yes! She loves animals, we have a few pets at home.\nBev: Well, we only have fish, they are pretty but not very interesting!\nGita: Suppose you're right! What time do we have to be at school on Wednesday?\nBev: Quite early, I think about 7.45, the bus leaves at 8 and we get to Holly Farm about 10, I think.\nGita: Hope the rain keeps off, especially if it's outdoors. I'll check their website.\nBev: Yes, good idea. Anyway, see you Weds, Gita!\nGita: Bye, Bev!",
