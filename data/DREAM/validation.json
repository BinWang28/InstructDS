I need to see the doctor.\n W: The doctor will be busy at the hospital until this evening. The earliest you could see him would be tomorrow morning at ten.\n M: The time is good for me. I'll come in then if that's okay.\n W: That will be fine; in the meantime you should try to take it easy.

Edward Murray is the author of a new biography of Dean. Good evening, Edward.\n M: Hello Tina.\n W: Edward, tell us what you know about Dean's early life.\n M: He was born in Indiana in 1931, but his parents moved to California when he was five. He wasn't there long though because his mother passed away just four years later. Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt.\n W: So how did he get into acting?\n M: Well, first he acted in plays at high school, then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting. In 1951 he moved to New York to do more stage acting.\n W: Then when did his movie career really start?\n M: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society.\n W: So how many more movies did he make?\n M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955.\n W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today?\n M: Well I guess his looks, his acting ability, his short life, and maybe the type of character he played in his movies.

Well, I'm happy that you could come. Do sit down, please.\n W: Dr. Francis, do you know I've got a chance to go to Cambridge in August?

But well,.., yes, I'm sure I can give you some useful tips. Now, what do you want to know, Li Ming?\n W: Things like weather. What's the usual temperature there?\n M: Mmm, the temperature in Scotland is 22, or 23 degrees Centigrade, on average, I think. But Cambridge would be warmer, around 25, I would guess, because it's down south.\n W: Oh, that's nice. Do you know it is 34 here? Last year it reached 39. By the way, where do you think I should stay?\n M: Oh, that's important. You can, err,.., I suppose, stay in the college-owned flats, which are often near where you have your classes, and some are even on the campus. That would certainly be convenient.\n W: Yes, it would.\n M: But it can also be a disadvantage because you are, in a sense, separated from ordinary society. You're a language teacher, and I think learning from society is a valuable experience.\n W: Yes, yes, exactly, so what's the alternative?\n M: Maybe finding an English host family.

What would you like to know?\n Caller: First of all, how big is it?\n Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer.\n Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex?\n Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure.\n Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all?\n Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher.\n Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent?\n Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month.\n Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me.\n Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate.\n Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities?\n Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door.\n Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time?\n Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit.\n Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit?\n Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of.\n Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in.\n Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back.\n Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus?\n Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front.\n Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy?\n Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine.\n Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants?\n Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year.\n Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning?\n Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then.\n Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located?\n Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant.\n Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed?\n Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that.\n Caller: Um, I have a rat ...\n Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you?\n Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage.

I'm calling about the ad for the apartment found in today's newspaper.\n Apartment Owner: Okay.\n Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away.\n Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know?\n Caller: First of all, how big is it?\n Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer.\n Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex?\n Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure.\n Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all?\n Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher.\n Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent?\n Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month.\n Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me.\n Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate.\n Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities?\n Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door.\n Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time?\n Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit.\n Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit?\n Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of.\n Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in.\n Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back.\n Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus?\n Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front.\n Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy?\n Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine.\n Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants?\n Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year.\n Caller: Uh ... I don't know.

He came home yesterday and said he'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher, Miss Sanderson. She said he didn't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress.\n W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary.\n M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon...\n W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time...\n M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me.\n W: Of course. What form is Michael in?\n M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins.\n W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him?\n M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street.\n W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake.\n M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson.\n W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit.\n M: What? How on earth could that have happened?

I actually work in London for the Green Peace organization. We've been going for a few decades and we're a non-violent, non-political organization. We're involved in anti-nuclear activity, conservation and protection of animals and protection and support of our eco-system. I'm the action organizer and arrange any protests.\n W: Right! A pretty important role, Peter. What sort of protest would you organize?\n M: Well, recently we've been involved in anti-nuclear campaigns. I've personally arranged for the demonstration against radioactive waste dumping in the Atlantic Ocean. We've got a few small Green Peace boats that we harass the dumping ship with.\n W: Say? Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"?\n M: Well, we circle round and round the ships and get in the way when they try to dump the drums of nuclear waste in the sea. We talk to the men and try to change, you know, yell at them to stop.

Were you thinking of any special place in particular?\n W: Well, I don't know really. Can you recommend anywhere?\n M: Well, there's London, of course.\n W: Well, no, no. I've been to London already. I think I'm looking for theatres and, erm, some of your pubs.\n M: Let me think now. There's Salisbury, there's Chichester. Chichester's got a very famous theatre. And of course York, very famous for its York Minster the Cathedral. Yeh, Edinburgh, Edinburgh in Scotland.\n W: Oh, I've not been to Scotland before. So, I mean, what have you got for Edinburgh?\n M: Well, let me look that up ... here we are. Exeter, Edinburgh. Now we've got a three-day inclusive trip erm.., that's by coach and that would cost you \u00a392.50, about $150. Alternatively, now just a moment. There's another three-day trip going by train, that's a tiny bit more expensive... also what we call inclusive.\n W: Yeh ... erm, how much is that one?\n M: That's \u00a3100, about $160.\n W: What about the accommodation that goes with that trip?\n M: Well, that is inclusive. It means... It's a three-star hotel, which is pretty good quality, right in the center of town. We've had a lot of customers who've stayed there and they have been perfectly happy. Er, it is what we call bed and breakfast though. Would that be all right?\n W: Oh, that would suit me fine, because I'd like to try some of that Scottish food, that haggis, whatever it is... so... so... that...\n M: Of course, so when would you like to go? This 3-day trip by train is only available in mid-week. That would be Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Would that suit you?\n W: Wonderful.\n M: All right.",

What time is it at?\n Mark: It starts at two and finishes at three thirty. It's only a quarter past one now. Do you think Sarah would like that?\n Jenny: How much is a ticket?\n Mark: Well, it's one pound fifty for adults and seventy-five pence for children. Programmes are twenty-five pence.\n Jenny: And does your library run a reading course in the holidays?\n Mark: Yes, and if children under ten, like Sarah, read four books in six weeks, we give them something to take home.\n Jenny: What, like a book?\n Mark: Well, this year it's a pen, but sometimes it's a book or a school bag.

        "dialogue": "Rental Car Agent: Hi. How can I help you?\n Customer: Yeah. I'd like to rent a mid-size car for three days.\n Rental Car Agent: Okay. Let me check to see if we have one available. Hmmm. It's doesn't look like we do. We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan.\n Customer: Well, what is the main difference between these cars?\n Agent: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you?\n Customer: Just me and my son.\n Rental Car Agent: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front.\n Customer: Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I don't think so.\n Rental Car Agent: Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows.\n Customer: Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway?\n Rental Car Agent: Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day.\n Customer: Wow, a little expensive. But what's the cost for mileage?\n Rental Car Agent: Hey, all of our cars have unlimited miles, but of course, that doesn't include gas.\n Customer: Yeah, right. I bet that car probably eats up gas, and now that were in the middle of the vacation season, gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices.\n Rental Car Agent: Well, as they say, it comes down to the law of supply an demand.\n Customer: Well, anyway, can you install a car seat in one of those cars? I have a 3-year-old son with me.\n Rental Car Agent: Sure, and that'll only be one dollar extra per day.\n Customer: I'll go with the full-size car. Wait, uh ... what does it look like?\n Rental Car Agent: Uh, it's right out there in the parking lot. [Which one?] The one over there next to the sidewalk.\n Customer: Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap? Ahhh.\n Rental Car Agent: Sir, excuse me. We take pride in our vehicles. It's just that it's one of the last cars on our lot, but it runs like a dream. Don't let the exterior fool you. Hey, I'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers. Will there be any other drivers?\n Customer: No, I'm the only driver.\n Rental Car Agent: Okay. Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan?\n Customer: What's that exactly?\n Rental Car Agent: Well, the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle, [Okay] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [Oh]. It even includes incidental road damage caused by, let's say, a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car. [Oh, uh, well ... ]. However, it won't cover loss of property due to theft. Too much crime in the area anyway. [What? Wh ... What about this crime? What, what?]. Don't worry about it. And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety-five per day. [But you were saying?] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem.\n Customer: But wouldn't my own car insurance cover those problems?\n Rental Car Agent: It might, but each insurance policy is different. With our car protection plan, however, you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [Well ... ], and we handle everything quickly, and you don't have to contact your own insurance company. Okay. Let me just confirm this. A full-size car with a car seat for three days [Yeah], plus the car protection package. Is that right? [That's right.] Okay, I'll have our mechanic, Louie, check the car over and pull it up to the door.\n Customer: Push it up to the door? I hope this car really runs.\n Rental Car Agent: Well, in case it does break down on some out-of-the-way, deserted road, just call the toll-free number for assistance. They'll come to assist you within ... two business days. [Two business days!!!] Enjoy your trip.",
