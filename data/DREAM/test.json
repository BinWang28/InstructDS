But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.\n W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?\n M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.\n W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?\n M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.",

Well, like. Listen, you know. Um, you've noticed she's been skipping work lately?\n Brandon: Well, she said she's been having some health problems, so I just figured it was that.\n Stacy: No, no, no. She's not. [ Are you sure? ] Yeah. It's, it's more than that. Like, a month ago, she asked me to lend her a thousand bucks to fix her car.\n Brandon: Wow. Man. Um, I mean, she didn't tell me anything like that. I mean, her car is running fine, I think.\n Stacy: Yeah, I know, it is. It's running fine. [ Oh, great. ] Exactly. She's lying a lot now, and she's, you know, she's trying to hide it, and she's good at hiding it.\n Brandon: And, I let her borrow my car a couple days ago, and I had fifty bucks in there, and when the car came back, it was gone. She's ... I don't know how else it could have disappeared. [ Man. I can't belive this. ] I'm pretty sure she stole it.\n Stacy: I know. Um, but she's hiding things, and she hides things from us, and okay, for example, like last week. I saw her with the two cell phones, and when I checked the texts on the one phone ....\n Brandon: Wait, wait. Two phones? What do you mean?\n Stacy: ....Yeah, umm.\n Brandon: She only has one.\n Stacy: No, she's got at least two phones, and when I checked the one phone, I saw some texts, and she was talking about, um, um, some drugs and needing to meet up with someone to buy them.\n Brandon: Ah, man.\n Stacy: I'm sorry, Brandon, um, I ... we need to, we need to confront her on this. You need to confront her on this.\n Brandon: I don't know how to do this. I mean ... yeah, I don't know.\n Stacy: I know, but you've got to. You, you can't ... the ... you know, you've got to do this if you want to try to hope that there's going to be anything to this relationship. It's, it's much better to talk to her openly about this now, cause, I promise you, the problems will just escalate, so ...\n Brandon: But, she might blow up.\n Stacy: She might, but hey, wait, listen. Why don't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together? You know, um ...\n Brandon: I just don't know.\n Stacy: I know, and you're right, she might blow up, but if you don't do anything, I promise the problems are just going to get bigger. She's probably going to end up losing her job, she's probably going to get arrested, and she might even die.\n Brandon: Man, you're probably right. I have to think about this and how to approach her. Alright. Let, let me thing about it, and I'll call you. [ Okay. ] Alright, thanks.\n Stacy: Alright. Bye, Brandon.",

If you don't like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't go and use another.\n M: Some people who write to me say this. They say that if you didn't have a monopoly, you wouldn't be able to do the things you do. Well, I don't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized.\n W: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized?\n M: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that.\n W: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared?\n M: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America.

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow!

[Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n Guest: My pleasure.",

        "dialogue": "Program Host: Hi and welcome to our new show, Exotic Animal Kingdom, a program geared toward introducing animals to the young and old. In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables.

And the other buildings that did not burn are being de-smoked. As to the cause of the fire, all we know is that we were having trouble with the pilot lights since we bought the stove in July and it had been serviced three times. Well, as a matter of fact, we think it was a malfunctioning stove that may have caused the fire. Nothing definite yet has been determined.\n W: Have you heard from other schools or other institutional users of this stove that have had the same problem?\n M: No. I wouldn't know anything more about the stove itself. All I know is that this fire went up so quickly that there's been a suspicion about why it went up so quickly. And it may be that there was a gas blast. But, again, this has not been determined officially by anybody.\n W: I got you. When do kids come back to school?\n M: Next Monday, and we will be ready for them. Monday January 4. We're just extremely thrilled that no one was hurt and that's because of the fire fighters that were here, nine of them. They're wonderful.\n W: And I'm sure you send your thanks out to them, uh?\n M: Well, we're sending out thanks to them in a letter or in any other way we can.

I waited an hour to sign up for a distance-learning course.\n M: Distance learning? Never heard of it.\n W: Well, it's new this semester. It's only open to psychology majors. But I bet it'll catch on elsewhere. Yesterday, over a hundred students signed up.\n M: Well, what is it?\n W: It's an experimental course. I registered for child psychology. All I have got to do is watch a twelve-week series of televised lessons. The department shows them several different times a day and in several different locations.\n M: Don't you ever have to meet with professor?\n W: Yeah. After each part of the series I have to talk to her and the other students on the phone, you know, about our ideas. Then we'll meet on campus three times for reviews and exams.\n M: It sounds pretty non-traditional to me. But I guess it makes sense, considering how many students have jobs. It must really help with their schedules, not to mention how it will cut down on traffic.\n W: You know,last year my department did a survey and they found out that 80 percent of all psychology majors were employed.

Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on, I can't see, I can't see the rationale behind really wanting an, an airport at all.\n M: Well, surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed. I mean, why should people, uhh...\n W: Well, they aren't being swarmed.\n M: Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of... a new airport here.\n W: But, but really people shouldn't be traveling that much, that's, that's why most of the journeys, I mean, they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on. It isn't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often.\n M: Well, you take the climate here in this country. Now just before Christmas, there was this dreadful cold spell, there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and, and a certain mild climate. And, and in summer, the same situation occurs. It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool.\n W: Well, yes, I can sympathize with that. But it is still not really necessary to do, well, as it isn't necessary to, to conserve fuel and it is necessary to, well, not to waste land. I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more. I mean it could be used for farming for instance.\n M: True.\n W: It could also be used for housing, or it could be used for parks, you know. People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far.\n M: But, airports do bring some local advantages. They bring roads, there is obviously extra employment, for instance, new hotels, shops, restaurants will have to be built. This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy.\n W: But you ask the people, you ask those who are now living near the airports, for instance, whether,whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages, although, all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways, and the whole area is, is desolated, isn't it?\n M: But the airport infra, ..., infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport, the pilots even, the stewardess, they have to live somewhere near the airport, right?\n W: Yeah, but it's, it's just so, so damaging to the whole area. I think, airports, from my point of view, the whole concept is outdated, really. Umm, with modern technology, we can make a lot of travel unnecessary, really. For example, it won't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody. They can just leave it to the telephone in the office, press the button, and say to the person they want to do business with. You see, business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth, right?\n M: Yes, you are right. But for a lot of people, personal contact is important.

The guide recommends one downtown a few blocks from the museum.\n M: Now that sounds great. After that, what do you think about visiting the zoo? Well, it says here there are some very unique animals not found anywhere else.\n W: Well, to tell the truth, I'm not really interested in going there. Why don't we go shopping instead? There are supposed to be some really nice places to pick up some bargain clothes.\n M: Nah, I don't think that's a good idea. We only have a few traveler's checks left. And I only have fifty dollars left in cash.\n W: No problem. We can use YOUR credit card to pay.\n M: Oh. No. I remember the last time you used MY credit card for YOUR new clothes.\n W: Oh well.

In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman?\n F: Is that the Walkman?\n M: No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial.\n F: How big is the whole thing?\n M: Oh, I'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms.\n F: Was it a success from the start?\n M: Funnily enough, a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around-and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price!\n F: Really?\n M: But, despite this pessimistic view, sales of this model far outnumbered projections.\n F: Well, you never can tell! How big was the initial production?\n M: The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982, but they still couldn't keep up with the demand.\n F: So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher.\n M: It was much more radical than that! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model.\n F: Oh, what's it like?\n M: Well, it's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less...\n F: Mmmm.\n M: and the components were designed from scratch.\n F: And what about production levels?\n M: They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market!\n F: Wow! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off.\n M: Indeed it has.\n F: And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well.\n M: Yes. At the end of 1982 Hattori-that's H-A-T-T-O-R-I--you know, the makers of Seiko watches-well, they unveiled an even smaller TV, around 3era, which is built into a wrist-watch.\n F: Incredible!\n M: It certainly is. The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes.\n F: And how does it work?\n M: It has a liquid crystal display screen.

What would you like to know?\n W: First of all, how was the standard weight used?\n M: Well, the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country. The department of weights and measures, we are a government agency. It's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales.\n W: How did you check the scales before?\n M: We have an old standard weight that we used to use. It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture.\n W: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less.\n M: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n W: How much did it cost?\n M: About 45 thousand dollars.\n W: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n M: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard. Think of the drug industry, for example, those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine.",
