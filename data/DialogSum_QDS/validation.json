After all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. For most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. We all suffer. Anyway, we try to comfort our children.\nLoretta: How?\nJennifer Benzes: We tell them we love them and will always do.\nLoretta: You haven't thought of saving the marriage?\nJennifer Benzes: Yes, we have. We would do anything to spare our children pain. But you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. Family conflicts may take hold like a cancer.\nLoretta: Then divorce is the only way to get rid of it.\nJennifer Benzes: It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing.\nLoretta: Yet most people believe a hard marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think?\nJennifer Benzes: I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. Parents quarreling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children.\nLoretta: What do you want society to do for you?\nJennifer Benzes: Understand us, not curse us. More importantly, they should help us share the loss and build a better future.",

You really want to dance to that?\nRuddie: It's not all techno music. It's not a special techno night.\nMelissa: No. But they play techno all the time. It drives me crazy after forty minutes. And anyhow, if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps. At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour. And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper. I know you.\nRuddie: It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club. I like Latin Music. The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock. What was that bar called?\nMelissa: Oh. You mean Jerry's, over on the east side. That wasn't my idea going there.\nRuddie: No. It was that friend of yours, Melissa. Her and all her lousy country music Cds. Yecch!\nMelissa: It's true. I would never go there again either. Country music is a nightmare. So is it the Latin Club?\nRuddie: Yes. You have to teach me the samba, and the tango, and whatever else they do.\nMelissa: Well, it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too, won't you?\nRuddie: Maybe.",

Who's getting the new jobs?\nLisa Lynch: As I mentioned, when we looked at the numbers, 'we are seeing employment across the board in all sectors, with one important exception, and that's in manufacturing. Well, we do not have any job loss in manufacturing sector for the first time in 44 months. We did not see pick up in the manufacturing sector, but we saw restaurant and hotel workers being added on. We saw workers in supermarket being added on. Part of that reflects the settlement of the grocery stores strike out California. We saw workers in the health care sector and hospitals being added on. We saw business services adding employees. So in general, with the very important exception of manufacturing, we are seeing job growth across all of these different types of occupations.",
