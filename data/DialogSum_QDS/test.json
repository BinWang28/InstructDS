I have decided to create my own company! I am going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself!\nIsidore: Have you ever written up a business plan before?\nShane: Well, no, it can't be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that's it, right?\nIsidore: You couldn't be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.\nShane: Well, that seems easy enough.\nIsidore: Wait, there is more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.\nShane: Geez. Is that all?\nIsidore: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!\nShane: Umm. I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business!",

This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

Pull up a chair. \nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \nSusan: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation. \nEmily: Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later! ",

When did you know you wanted to have your own company?\nTom: My family left Budapest in 1986 and settled in Canada where a lot of my friends' parents were highly successful businessmen. It seems so cool, so in high school, I started a web-designed company and learned a lot from that experience.\nOdessa: How did you find the money for your present company then?\nTom: We've raised 18 million dollars from about 50 people. We're finally making money. I own 6% of the company and all employees get their shares.\nOdessa: By the way, what aspects of your life are green?\nTom: I'm only mildly green. I do simple things and I'm a huge biker. I biked cross Canada.\nOdessa: Do you think you have ever done anything wasteful?\nTom: We're always doing something wrong, but then, that will allow us to learn and grow. When I first started out, we made all the products ourselves, but that was a mistake. Now we work with other companies. We provide the materials, the product development and the design. They make the products then.",

        "dialogue": "Agatha: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.\nShawn: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.\nAgatha: About what time would you think that they were there?\nShawn: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.\nAgatha: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.\nShawn: In fact, yes, as short as that.\nAgatha: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?\nShawn: Fifty meters.\nAgatha: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?\nShawn: Yes.

Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment, nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money.\nRaul: Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that. If you are sure, we can go ahead now, Sir. How does 10 am tomorrow sound, to get all of the paperwork out of the way?",

You lose. \nBrook: Oh, well. So you get the bottom bunk. What about our stereos? It looks like we both brought our stereos.

I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room. \nDave: Probably we can put one on that counter. And we can put one on the floor by the bed. Over there. \nBrook: Alright. That's a good plan. What about the desks? We have two desks, one by the window and one by the door? Which one do you want? \nDave: Well, the desk by the window is nicer, of course. Don't you think? \nBrook: Yes, I agree. \nDave: So since I got the bottom bunk, why don't you get the desk by the window? That would be more fair. \nBrook: Alright. \nDave: I mean, we could flip a coin for it, but I would probably win again. I'm incredibly lucky you know.

I'm always willing to help beginners. Just call me Big Brother Dave. \nBrook: Are all lucky people so stuck up? \nDave: C'mon, don't take it seriously! I'm just kidding. \nBrook: Anyway, I get the desk by the window, you get the bottom bunk. That's it. \nDave: Why don't we start unpacking these boxes? \nBrook: I will go get something to eat.
